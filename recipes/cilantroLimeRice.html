		<ul>

			<li><b>¼ teaspoon salt</b></li>
			<li><b>4 garlic cloves</b>, minced</li>

		<legend><strong>Procedure</strong></legend>
		<ol>
			<li>Use large, deep skillet or a large sauce pan.
			</li>
			<li>Add chicken broth, uncooked rice, ¼ teaspoon salt and minced garlic to the skillet (or pan). Bring to
				boil.
				Mix everything well. Reduce the heat to low boil simmer. Cover the skillet with the lid. Simmer for
				15-20
				minutes, covered, until the rice is cooked through.</li>
			<li>Remove the skillet from heat. Mix in 1 tablespoon of freshly squeezed lime juice, black beans (rinsed
				and
				drained), and fresh cilantro into the cooked rice. Taste, and add more salt and/or another small amount
				of
				lime juice (at most 1 extra tablespoon, try adding half of extra tablespoon first).
			</li>
			<li>Note: I think 2 tablespoons of lime juice (freshly squeezed only!) are just perfect, but the lime flavor
				might be too strong for some people, so you might use just 1 or 1.5 tablespoon instead of 2 that I used.
			</li>
