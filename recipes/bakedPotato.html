		<Strong>Season the Potatoes</Strong>
		Start off by rinsing and scrubbing the potatoes. Then, pierce each potato with a fork or knife so that steam can
		escape when baking. Coat the potato with olive oil (you can use your hands to rub it all over the skin or place
		the potato and oil in a zip-top bag and shake it up) and season with salt.

	<p> <Strong>Top Potatoes</Strong>

			<li><b>1 medium size Potato</b> STARCHY Not WAXY, Russet if possible</li>
			<li><b>1 teaspoon Olive oil</b>(uncooked, need 15 minutes to cook)</li>

		<legend><strong>Procedure</strong></legend>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Scrub the potato, and pierce the skin several times
				with a knife or fork. Rub the skin with olive oil, then with salt.
			</li>
			<li>Place the potato in the preheated oven, and bake until slightly soft and golden brown, about 90 minutes.
				Slice the potato down the center, and serve with butter and black pepper. Sprinkle shredded Cheddar
				cheese over the top, if desired.</li>
			<li>Remove the skillet from heat. Mix in 1 tablespoon of freshly squeezed lime juice, black beans (rinsed
				and
				drained), and fresh cilantro into the cooked rice. Taste, and add more salt and/or another small amount
				of
				lime juice (at most 1 extra tablespoon, try adding half of extra tablespoon first).
			</li>
			<li>Note: I think 2 tablespoons of lime juice (freshly squeezed only!) are just perfect, but the lime flavor
				might be too strong for some people, so you might use just 1 or 1.5 tablespoon instead of 2 that I used.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Variation</h2>
		For a treat, try slicing the very top of the potato off rather than slicing it in two, forming a 'lid'. Scoop
		out the fluffy contents of the potato, keeping the skin intact. Mix the potato in a bowl with butter, grated
		cheese and black pepper, then spoon the mixture back into the skin. Replace the lid and serve.
